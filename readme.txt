Do not install this plugin. It is an experiment that breaks Appearance -> Themes.

== Description ==

This plugin is an ongoing experiment around improving the theme experience in WordPress. This is meant only for development work, and the brave of heart, as it totally breaks themes.php.

Discussions will happen at http://make.wordpress.org/ui/ if you'd like to participate. All comments and contributions are welcome.

(Plugin assumes mp6 UI)
